Welcome to SUGAR training folder. Here are some useful scripts to prepare training dataset and the main scripts for training. 

We used the fk program to calculate the synthetic waveforms. 

Step 1 : run "to_fk_allst_big.py". 

This will generate many outputs in the folder "random_event_allst". The initial generation of event locations and magnitudes have been commented. You need to modify the code. Those csv files numbered 0 to 999 are 1000 input earthquakes information with different location and magnitude for fk calculation.
